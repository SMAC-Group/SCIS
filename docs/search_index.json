It is based on the Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments (GMWM) of Guerrier et al. (2013), which is a new statistical approach to estimate the parameters of (complex) time series models. The GMWM is able to estimate efficiently time series models which are commonly used to describe the errors of inertial sensors. This calibration approach provides considerable improvements (in terms of navigation performance) compared to existing methods. This methodology is robust (potentially applicable for FDI purposes) and is able to automatically select a suitable model (or rank models). The GMWM estimator is a GMM type estimator based on a quantity called the Wavelet Variance (WV). This quantity is computed by taking the variance of the Wavelet Coefficient wich are defined as Definition 5.1 (Wavelet Coefficient) In a similar way to the AV, we can define the Wavelet Variance (WV) at dyadic scales (\\(\\tau_j\\)) for \\(j \\in \\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\, : \\; 1 \\leq x &lt; \\log_2 (T) - 1 \\right\\}\\). To do so, we first need to define the wavelet filters \\(h_{j,l}\\) as ``weights’’ having the following properties \\[\\begin{equation*} \\sum_{l=0}^{L_j-1} h_{j,l}=0, \\,\\, \\sum_{l=0}^{L_1-1} h_{1,l}^2 =\\frac{1}{2} \\, \\mathrm{and } \\, \\sum_{l=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h_{1,l} h_{1,l+2m} = 0 , \\label{def:wvfilter} \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(m \\in \\mathbb{N}^+\\), \\(L_j = (2^j-1)(L_1-1)+1\\) is the length of the filter at level \\(j\\) and \\(L_1\\) is the length of the first level filter \\(h_{1,l}\\).\\[0.2cm] Then, the wavelet coefficients \\(W_{j,t}\\) are defined as \\[\\begin{equation*} W_{j,t} = \\sum_{l=0}^{L_j-1}h_{j,l} X_{t-l}. \\end{equation*}\\] There exist many type of Wavelet Filter. In this book, we will focus on the Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT), which is the most usefull one. Figure 5.1: MODWT Wavelet Coefficient References "]
