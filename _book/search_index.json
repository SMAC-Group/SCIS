Why read this book It is very important… Structure of the book Chapters ?? introduces a new topic, and … Software information and conventions I used the knitr package (???) and the bookdown package (Xie 2018) to compile my book. My R session information is shown below: sessionInfo() ## R version 3.4.2 (2017-09-28) ## Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 (64-bit) ## Running under: macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS: /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libBLAS.dylib ## LAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.4/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib ## ## locale: ## [1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8 ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets ## [6] methods base ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] Rcpp_0.12.16 bookdown_0.7.10 digest_0.6.15 ## [4] rprojroot_1.2 mime_0.5 backports_1.1.1 ## [7] magrittr_1.5 evaluate_0.10.1 xaringan_0.6.2 ## [10] highr_0.6 stringi_1.1.7 rstudioapi_0.7 ## [13] rmarkdown_1.9 tools_3.4.2 servr_0.9 ## [16] stringr_1.3.0 httpuv_1.3.6.2 xfun_0.1 ## [19] yaml_2.1.18 compiler_3.4.2 htmltools_0.3.6 ## [22] knitr_1.20 Package names are in bold text (e.g., rmarkdown), and inline code and filenames are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g., knitr::knit('foo.Rmd')). Function names are followed by parentheses (e.g., bookdown::render_book()). Acknowledgments A lot of people helped me when I was writing the book. Frida Gomam on the Mars References "],

["allan-variance.html", "Chapter 1 Allan Variance", " Chapter 1 Allan Variance The Allan Variance (AV) is a statistical technique originally developed in the mid-1960s to study the stability of precision oscillators (see e.g. Allan 1966). It can provide information on the types and magnitude of various superimposed noise terms (i.e. composite stochastic processes). This method has been adapted to characterize the properties of a variety of devices including inertial sensors (see El-Sheimy, Hou, and Niu 2008). The AV is a measure of variability developed for long term memory processes and can in fact be interpreted as a Haar wavelet coefficient variance (see Percival and Guttorp 1994). We will discuss this connection further on. Definition 1.1 We consider the AV at dyadic scales (\\(\\tau_j\\)) starting from local averages of the process which can be denoted as \\[\\begin{equation*} \\bar{X}_{t}^{(j)} \\equiv \\frac{1}{\\tau_j} \\sum_{i = 1}^{\\tau_j} X_{t - \\tau_j + i}\\, , \\label{mean.noav} \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(\\tau_j \\equiv 2^j, \\; j \\in \\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\, : \\; 1 \\leq x &lt; \\log_2 (T) - 1 \\right\\}\\) therefore determines the number of consecutive observations considered for the average. Then, the AV is defined as \\[\\begin{equation*} \\AV_j \\left(X_t \\right) \\equiv \\frac{1}{2} \\, \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left(\\bar{X}_{t}^{(j)} - \\bar{X}_{t-\\tau_j}^{(j)} \\right)^2 \\right]. \\end{equation*}\\] References "],
