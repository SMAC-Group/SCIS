# Allan Variance

- The Allan Variance (AV) is a statistical technique originally developed in the mid-1960s to study the stability of precision oscillators [see e.g. @allan1966statistics].
- It can provide information on the types and magnitude of various superimposed noise terms (i.e. composite stochastic processes). 
- This method has been adapted to characterize the properties of a variety of devices including inertial sensors [see @elsheimy08av].
- The AV is a measure of variability developed for long term memory processes and can in fact be interpreted as a Haar wavelet coefficient variance [see @percival1994long]. We will discuss this connection further on.


```{definition, defAV, name = "Allan Variance"}
We consider the AV at dyadic scales ($\tau_j$) starting from local averages of the process which can be denoted as

\begin{equation*} 
    \bar{X}_{t}^{(j)} \equiv \frac{1}{\tau_j} \sum_{i = 1}^{\tau_j} X_{t - \tau_j + i}\, ,
    \label{mean.noav}
\end{equation*}

where $\tau_j \equiv 2^j, \; j  \in \left\{x \in \mathbb{N} \, : \;  1 \leq x < \log_2 (T) - 1 \right\}$ therefore determines the number of consecutive observations considered for the average. Then, the AV is defined as

\begin{equation*}
    AV_j \left(X_t \right) \equiv \frac{1}{2} \, \mathbb{E}\left[ \left(\bar{X}_{t}^{(j)} - \bar{X}_{t-\tau_j}^{(j)} \right)^2 \right].
\end{equation*}

The definition of the AV is actually valid for ... $\lfloor \rfloor$
