# Preface {-}

Hi there, this is my great book.

## Why read this book {-}

It is very important...

## Structure of the book {-}

Chapters \@ref(introduction) introduces a new topic, and ...

## Software information and conventions {-}

I used the **knitr**\index{knitr} package [@xie2015] and the **bookdown**\index{bookdown} package [@R-bookdown] to compile my book. My R session information is shown below:

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

Package names are in bold text (e.g., **rmarkdown**), and inline code and filenames are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g., `knitr::knit('foo.Rmd')`). Function names are followed by parentheses (e.g., `bookdown::render_book()`).

## Acknowledgments {-}

A lot of people helped me when I was writing the book.
